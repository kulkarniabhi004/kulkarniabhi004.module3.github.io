Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent. Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC. Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages.For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of chicken have been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere, including capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was "sought by the rich because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish. "Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork. In Europe, consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy</p></div>
         <div id="beef"class="col-xs-10 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><a name='beef'></a><p id="p2">Beef</p><p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.</p></div>
          <div id="sushi" class="col-xs-10 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><a name='sushi'></a><p id="p3">Sushi</p><p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits.n the 7th century, Southeast Asians introduced the technique of pickling. After 500 years, the Japanese acquired this same practice which consisted of packing fish with rice. As the fish fermented, the rice produced a lactic acid which in turn caused the pickling of the pressed fish. This was the very first form of sushi, and it was called Nare-Sushi. Then in 15th and 16th century, an altered form, Nama-Nare, appeared due to lengthy process. After a century, Matsumoto Yoshiichi of Edo introduced the use of rice vinegar into the sushi rice to add a flavor of tartness. One of the best known kinds of sushi, nigiri, wasnft introduced until 1820fs by Hanaya Yohei of Edo. His morsels, which included fresh sliced raw fish combined with the vinegared rice, were prepared and served for customers directly from his portable sushi stall. It eventually won immediate demands over the nation and descended the sushi bars of today. One of the typical nigiri sushi we eat is maguro, tuna sushi. In my experience, therefs not just one tuna sushi, but quite a few, such as an albacore tuna, a white tuna, a fatty tuna, and the regular tuna. Just like other sushi, vinegared rice and a piece of tuna are, at least, required to make a tuna sushi. Once they are ready, by taking a small portion of the rice to the middle of a hand, pressing it with fingers to make it form nicely round and fairly long, and placing a sliced tuna on top of it, maguro is made.The Japanese live long, and this is already a well known fact. One of the proven secrets of longevity is that they eat fish, a lot of them. ‚·‚µ, the highlight of their fish cuisine, became very popular all over the world and had been representing Japanese food ever since. There is even a word in English: Sushi. There are numerous types of sushi such as nigiri-sushi, maki-sushi, and sashimi.</p></div>
